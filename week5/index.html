   <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>

<p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by: System error, Programmer error, User error.</p> <br>
<p><b>Exceptions</b> an exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. </p>
<p><b>Stack trace</b> this is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. An exception can also produce a stack trace.</p>
<p><b>Warnings</b> a warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning. </p><br>


<h3>Debugging Methods</h3>
<p><b>Linting Tools</b> linting tools such as JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint are designed to highlight any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented.Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more consistent and less likely to have problems.</p>   
<p><b>Feature Detection</b> is used to determine if a browser support a feature.This is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method. </p>
<p><b>Alert</b> the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code.It allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be</p>
<p><b>Console.log()</b> this can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program, although it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does. </p>
<p><b>Console.trace()</b> it shows an an interactive stack trace in the console. This will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while the code is running.</p>
<p><b>Debugger</b> t his is a keyword that can be used in different browsers and will allow us to create a breakpoint in our code that will pause the execution of the code and allow us to see where the program is currently up to.</p>
<p><b>Exception Handling</b> is the best way to catch errors and identify where the errors are generated despite the program does not crash or the users do not see the error.To use Exception Handling properly is necessary to use <b>try</b>,<b>catch</b> and <b>finally</b>. </p>

<b>Questions</b> <br>
<p>How the error objects are used? and How they work?</p>

<p><b>//Code Sanbox Chapter 8 exercises. Try it on Console</b>


   <p>class MultiplicatorUnitFailure extends Error</p>  <br>
    
   <p>function primitiveMultiply(a, b) {<br>
      if (Math.random() < 0.2) {<br>
        return a * b;<br>
      } else {<br>
        throw new MultiplicatorUnitFailure("Klunk");<br>
      }<br>
    }</p> <br>
    
    <p>  function reliableMultiply(a, b) {<br>
      for (;;) {<br>
        try {<br>
          return primitiveMultiply(a, b);<br>
        } catch (error) {<br>
          if (error instanceof MultiplicatorUnitFailure == false)<br>
            throw error;<br>
         }<br>
       }<br>
    }<br>
}</p> <br>
    
    console.log(reliableMultiply(8, 8));<br>
    // → 64</p><br>
