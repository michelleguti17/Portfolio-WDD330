            <p><b> What is localStorage in JavaScript?</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                LocalStorage is a property that allows sites and apps to save key-value pairs
                in a web browser with no expiration date, despite it get closed or not.
            </p>
            <p><b>Why are key-values important in localStorage?</b></p>
            <p>The key-values are in charge of storage objects which help to keep intact the objects in local Storage and use them later. One example could be when we have shopped in an online store many times, and every time we check out, our information is ready to be filled in the form thanks to the auto fill because it was saved from the last time, we bought it. </p>
